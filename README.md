<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Akash singh</h1>

 This is [GPT-3](https://akash-0310-gpt-3.netlify.app/) an GPT-3 Clone.
 <p>GPT-3 clone,Back when I was learning the basics of React.js, I decided to challenge myself by building a GPT-3 Clone — because why not try to recreate an AI when you’re just starting out? 😂
It was both fun and frustrating (mostly fun… after it finally worked 😅), and it definitely pushed me to think beyond “Hello World”.
Big shoutout to JavaScript Mastery for the awesome Figma design that I replicated into code 🙌
Sometimes the best way to learn is to just jump in, break things, and fix them again 🚀.</p>
